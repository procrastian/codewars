You may want to challenge yourself to:

Use the functions to draw your own picture.
Add more ways of drawing to the image data (ex. drawCircle(x: number, y: number, radius: number), drawLine(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number)).
Provide different values for onChar and offChar to outputImage (ex. outputImage("\u2588") or outputImage("O", "\u2588"))
