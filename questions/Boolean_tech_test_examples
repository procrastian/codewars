# Boolean tech test examples

1 - Given an array, print elements in alternating order, first-last-etc…
example

> f([1,2,3,4])
> 1
> 4
> 2
> 3
<!-- 
2 - Given an array of numbers, pick the ones divisible by 2 and put them in another array; then remove the ones divisible by 3 from the original array. Then print them
example:

> f([1,4,8,9])
> [1,4,8]
> [4,8] -->

3 - Code a function to write an object entries as a string, formatted like: “Key is: <>; value is: <>”. If a value is equal to its key, remove them from the original object and put the formatted string in an array. Then print both the object and the array
example:

> f({”aa”: 1, “bb”: "bb"})
> {”aa”:1}
> [”Key is: bb; value is: bb”]

4 - Get the lowest and highest number in an array and print them
Given two arrays, print true if they are mirrored, and false otherwise; e.g.: check if they have the same elements, but with inverted orders
example

> f([1,2,3], [3,2,1])
> true
